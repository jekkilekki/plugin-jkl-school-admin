If you want to help translate the plugin into your language, please have a look 
at the `.pot` file which contains all definitions and may be used with a [gettext] 
editor.

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, 
you can send your [gettext .po or .mo file] to me so that I can bundle it in the
plugin.

##Documentation & Support
